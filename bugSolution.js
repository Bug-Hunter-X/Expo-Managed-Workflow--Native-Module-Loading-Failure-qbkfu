The solution depends on the specific native module causing the problem. Here are some strategies:

1. **Check for Expo Compatibility:** Refer to the library's documentation.  Many libraries provide instructions or pre-built packages for use with Expo.

2. **Use Expo Modules:**  If possible, find Expo modules that offer similar functionality without requiring native modules.  These are designed for seamless integration with the Expo ecosystem.

3. **Eject (Use EAS Build):** As a last resort, consider ejecting from the managed workflow and using EAS Build or a similar service to build your app.  This gives you more control over the build process, allowing you to directly manage native dependencies. However, this is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it loses the benefits of Expo's managed workflow.

4. **Alternative Library:** Find an alternative library with better Expo support or that doesn't rely on native modules.

**Example (bugSolution.js):**

This example assumes you're using a problematic library and want to find and use an alternative.

```javascript
// Instead of importing the problematic library...
// import ProblematicLibrary from 'problematic-library';

// Import a compatible alternative.
import ExpoAlternativeLibrary from 'expo-alternative-library';

// Use the alternative library...
ExpoAlternativeLibrary.someFunction();
```
