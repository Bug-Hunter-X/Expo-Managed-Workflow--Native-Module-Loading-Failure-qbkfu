# Expo Managed Workflow: Native Module Loading Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's managed workflow with a library that depends on native modules.  The issue is that the native modules fail to load correctly, resulting in runtime errors or unexpected behavior. The error messages are often unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

The core problem is the inability of the Expo Go app or a standalone build to properly load required native modules.  This frequently happens when using libraries that rely on platform-specific code (e.g., for camera access, Bluetooth interaction, etc.).  The app might crash, exhibit unexpected behavior, or simply fail silently without clear indication of the issue.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file shows a simplified example of how this bug can manifest.  The specific library and error will vary depending on the native module used.

## Solution

The recommended solution is to use Expo's `expo install` to add modules. But sometimes it does not work as expected. In `bugSolution.js` another approach is provided, by checking the library's documentation for Expo compatibility or exploring alternative libraries that don't require native modules or offer a well-supported Expo integration.
